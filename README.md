# python-api-challenge
In this project I used api urls to analyze the weather as you approach the equator. To achieve this, I used dataframes from pandas and matplotlibs in jupyter notebook. I also used statistical analysis from my plots to better analyze the data. The data I used was from over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used to open weather api to find this data.

The second part of this assignment focused on finding a suitible hotel to vacation at based on its weather. I used the weather and coordinate data from the first part of the project, and used geoapify and geoviews to find hotels with suitible weather and humidity for a vacation. 

Anyone that wants to look at my results, can find them in the Vacationpy and Weatherpy files in the starter code folder. The data I used can be found in the output data file in the starter code folder.
